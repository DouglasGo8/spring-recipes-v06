. POJOs are classified in application layers. in Spring these layers are three: persistence, service, and presentation.
@Component is a general-purpose annotation to decorate POJOs for Spring detection, whereas @Repository, @Service, and @Controller are specializations of @Component for more specific cases of POJOs associated with the persistence, service, and presentation layers.
if you’re unsure about a POJO’s purpose, you can decorate it with the @Component annotation.
However, it’s better to use the specialization annotations where possible, because these provide extra facilities based on a POJO’s purpose (e.g., @Repository causes exceptions to be wrapped up as DataAccessExceptions, which makes debugging easier).

. Any method definitions decorated with the @Bean annotation generate a bean name based on the method name.
Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the bean name in the @Bean annotation with the name attribute (e.g., @Bean(name="mys1") makes the bean available as mys1; if you explicitly specify the bean name, the method name is ignored for purposes of bean creation).

When applying include filters to detect all classes whose name contains the word Dao or Service, even classes that don’t have annotations are auto-detected.
